Analyzing 120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results. This project involves data cleaning in Excel &amp; visualisation in Power BI, highlighting country &amp; athlete performance trends.

Data Preparation
Cleaning Process: Utilised Excel to clean the dataset by removing duplicates, addressing missing values with appropriate strategies, and structuring data for analysis.
Data Modelling: Segregated the dataset into dimension and fact tables to optimise visualisation and analysis in Power BI.

Visualisation & Insights
Country-wise athlete participation and medal performance.
Sport and athlete-centric metrics highlighting performance trends.
Key comparisons such as gender distribution, age demographics, and sport popularity across nations.

This project marks my inaugural step into data analysis, blending data wrangling with visualisation to uncover Olympic history insights.
